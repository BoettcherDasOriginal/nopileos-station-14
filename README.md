Nopileos Station 14 is a fork of [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14) that runs on [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox), our homegrown engine written in C#.

This is the primary repo for Nopileos Station 14.

If you want to host or create content for NS14, this is the repo you need. It contains both RobustToolbox and the content pack for development of new content packs.
